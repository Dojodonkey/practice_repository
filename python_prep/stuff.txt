1.) What does the following function do?
 Be sure to identify the output value.

def do_something(dictionary):
    return sorted(dictionary.keys())[1].upper()

my_dict = {
    'Karl':     108,
    'Clare':    175,
    'Karis':    140,
    'Trevor':   180,
    'Antonina': 132,
    'Chris':    101,
}

print(do_something(my_dict))

>>> CHRIS

#first the dictionary.keys() collects are the keys in the dict. 
#then sorted() call oranized the keys alphabetically. 
#Lastly the first index is capitalized. 
# my_dict is programmed and the print call returns the function
#with my_dict as the argument.

2.) 
Use the sqrt function from the math library
 to write some code that outputs the square root of 37.
 Try to write the code in three different ways.

import math

print(math.sqrt(37)) 

import math as m 

print(m.sqrt(37))

from math import sqrt

print(sqrt(37)) 

3.)
Write a nested function in sum_of_squares
 that will make this code work as shown.

def sum_of_squares(num1, num2):
	**  def squared(number): **
		**  return number * number **
    return squared(num1) + squared(num2)

print(sum_of_squares(3, 4))   # 25 (3 * 3 + 4 * 4)
print(sum_of_squares(5, 12))  # 169 (5 * 5 + 12 * 12)
